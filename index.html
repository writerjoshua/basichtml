      <h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
<p>I write from the heart and tell it like it is. I can be light hearted and witty or I can get straight to the point in intricate detail. I might write about something fun like video games and cat videos or I may delve into some scientific concepts and social commentary.</p>
<p>I have written a few short stories but, that was some time ago. I’ve written and recorded my own music but, that was also in the past. I am currently enrolled in online classes, pursuing my Associates in Applied Business management with an Environmental Focus so, I intend to share some of my past writing assignments on the subject.</p>
<p>I currently rely on social security disability and familial generosity but, I would rather establish a reputable business. At one point, I thought social media was going to allow me to do that but, corporate greed disguised as a helpful algorithm all but destroyed any hopes of reaching potential customers. So, I’ve given up on “chasing the dream” with social media and investing in my own website. </p>
<p> I am building this from scratch, code and all, so it may lack some of the bells and whistles that make other sites seem interesting but, what I might lack in features, I will more than make up for in content. I am looking for a solution that would allow you to subscribe to new blog posts. I don’t feel comfortable providing my home address, a requirement for sending email publications, so if you have any solution, please reach out.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of some of the subjects I will cover. Once I have established a few posts, they will become links:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Environmental Science</li>
	<li>Finance and Investing</li>
	<li>Sports</li>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Agriculture</li>
	<li>Renewable Energy</li>
	<li>Video Games</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Culture and Opinion</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> Thank You,
<br> Joshua Lucero

      <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>I despise what advertising has become. They literally view us as herd animals to be manipulated. They have crossed the line from anticipating our needs to coercing our behavior. There is no gray area. So, I will not be monetizing this site with ads, no matter how well they can target you. It seems like every website I visit is littered with them, so on the rare occasion that I land on one with minimal or even no ads, I appreciate it. I hope that you feel that way when you visit this site.</p>
      <p>With that, it is still my intention to earn an honest living creating content. If you are interested, there are a few direct ways, such as PayPal and CashApp, and I will also share some referral links from products and companies that I use personally and believe that you would appreciate. 
	      <br>No tricks. 
	      <br>
	      No gimmick.</p>

        <h4>$WriterJoshua on Cash App</h4>
        <p>Cash App allowed me access to the stock market for the first time. By making it possible to purchase fractions of shares, it made the entire market more affordable. You can invest in many companies for as little as a dollar. It also has functionality that allows you send and receive money. Scan the QR code or use <a href="https://cash.app/$writerjoshua">$WriterJoshua on Cash App</a> to send cash if you like what I do and want to support.</p>

        <p>I've been using the Savor One Rewards Card since 2022 to get 4% back on all of my monthly subscriptions, like Netflix and Disney+, and when I use it restaurants. I also get 3% back when I use it at the grocery store. It really adds up. Now, when you're approved using my <a href="https://capital.one.4002gKv">Savor Rewards Card link</> I'll get $100. </p>
