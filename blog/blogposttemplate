      <p>Welcome to my website!</p><p>I write from the heart and tell it like it is. I can be light hearted and witty or I can get straight to the point in intricate detail. I might write about something fun like video games and cat videos or I may delve into some scientific concepts and social commentary.</p>
<p>I have written a few short stories but, that was some time ago. I’ve written and recorded my own music but, that was also in the past. I am currently enrolled in online classes, pursuing my Associates in Applied Business management with an Environmental Focus so, I intend to share some of my past writing assignments on the subject.</p>
<p>I currently rely on social security disability and familial generosity but, I would rather establish a reputable business. At one point, I thought social media was going to allow me to do that but, corporate greed disguised as a helpful algorithm all but destroyed any hopes of reaching potential customers. So, I’ve given up on “chasing the dream” with social media and investing in my own website. </p>
<p> I am building this from scratch, code and all, so it may lack some of the bells and whistles that make other sites seem interesting but, what I might lack in features, I will more than make up for in content. I am looking for a solution that would allow you to subscribe to new blog posts. I don’t feel comfortable providing my home address, a requirement for sending email publications, so if you have any solution, please reach out.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of some of the subjects I will cover. Once I have established a few posts, they will become links:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Environmental Science</li>
	<li>Finance and Investing</li>
	<li>Sports</li>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Agriculture</li>
	<li>Renewable Energy</li>
	<li>Video Games</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Culture and Opinion</li>
</ul>
<p> Thank You,
