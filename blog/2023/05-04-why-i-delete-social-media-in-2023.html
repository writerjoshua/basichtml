<h2>Why I Delete Social Media in 2023</h2>
<h3>June 2023</h3>
<p>
Let’s not pretend that we don’t know what went wrong. Once they realized that the most valuable asset was attention, and that they could manipulate it, the “new world” was over. I’ve been around since well before MySpace but, I was there at the beginning of Facebook and Twitter. I was a bit late but, still early to Instagram. Social Media, for all intents and purposes, was the digital era Gold Rush.
<p>
“Head West. Stake your claim. There’s enough for everyone to strike it rich!” The crazy thing is, it was true! It was a literal world marketplace. I like to picture it as a universal swap meet. You show up, present your wares, and the entire world interacted. There was no algorithm, no ideal post time, no keyword strategy. It was just, being on the internet. It was remarkable, really.
<p>
It’s not that anymore, is it? It’s impossible to build a brand without already having an established brand presence. That’s by design. It’s money. It comes down to money. Greed is probably more accurate. Preferential treatment. Maybe even further, preferential dis treatment. “Algorithms to show more of what you want to see.” Pfft! It went from world marketplace to abandoned strip mall incredibly quick. Advertising, lol.
<p>
They got greedy. They saw an oasis in the desert. A beautiful stream of water, enough for all of us, then dug it up to maximize profits and wasted it all trying to keep it for themselves.
<p>
I’m sure there’s political nonsense in it, too. You remember all of the social uprisings as people around the world were finally able to communicate in real time at a grand scale. The glass door effect. Overnight, every agenda on the planet was exposed to the light of day. The world has never been the same.
<p>
So, here we are, pretending that we need advertisers. We don’t need you. We CERTAINLY don’t need you targeting us even more aggressively. If you monopolize the “desire” sector, where does that line between what we want and what you want us to want exist? We know your shit don’t work. No, I don’t want some “bro” to ambush my YouTube videos, mentally abusing me into flipping houses or listen to some poorly written voice bot tell me my body isn’t good enough but, there’s a miracle to fix it. That will NEVER generate a click, let alone conversion, from me. We. Don’t. Need. You.
<p>
So, to my point. This is my first post in Medium. As you may have gathered, I’ve explored just about every social media there is. I’m trying to make a living (like they all tell me I can) being a content creator. Not an influencer. Not a meme generator or a glorified pyramid scheme but, a genuine creator, a contributor to society. I have been eternally disappointed.
<p>
A few months ago, I found Substack. It seemed incredibly promising. There was positive talk, from founders on the platform, about how it was going ti be different. All the same misgivings I had about social media seemed ti be addressed. I thought “these guy’s really get it.” I had high hopes and as you imagine, I’m extremely skeptical. Today, though, I received two “notifications” from writers I have NOTHING to do with. I don’t follow them. I’ve never liked, even read, any of their posts. I haven’t even expressed any desire to see their content. This is how it started, the demise of social media.
<p>
Notifications are direct interactions on content: likes, replies, shares, etc. I get that you want to “share with me the wonderful world of your ecosystem” but, that’s not a notification. You do that and I’ll considered my trust violated. If I ask you to recommend “accounts to follow” then, by all means, fire up that algorithm to sift through my activities and connect me to an account that is similar to my interests. DO NOT try to force feed me stuff that you think will “increase my engagement” on your website application.
I don’t think I’m asking too much.

      <p>I despise what advertising has become. They literally view us as herd animals to be manipulated. They have crossed the line from anticipating our needs to coercing our behavior. There is no gray area. So, I will not be monetizing this site with ads, no matter how well they can target you. It seems like every website I visit is littered with them, so on the rare occasion that I land on one with minimal or even no ads, I appreciate it. I hope that you feel that way when you visit this site.</p>
      <p>With that, it is still my intention to earn an honest living creating content. If you are interested, there are a few direct ways, such as PayPal and CashApp, and I will also share some referral links from products and companies that I use personally and believe that you would appreciate.

	      No gimmick.</p>

        <h4>$WriterJoshua on Cash App</h4>
        <p>Cash App allowed me access to the stock market for the first time. By making it possible to purchase fractions of shares, it made the entire market more affordable. You can invest in many companies for as little as a dollar. It also has functionality that allows you send and receive money. Scan the QR code or use <a href="https://cash.app/$writerjoshua">$WriterJoshua on Cash App</a> to send cash if you like what I do and want to support.</p>
