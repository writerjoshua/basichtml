      <p>I despise what advertising has become. They literally view us as herd animals to be manipulated. They have crossed the line from anticipating our needs to coercing our behavior. There is no gray area. So, I will not be monetizing this site with ads, no matter how well they can target you. It seems like every website I visit is littered with them, so on the rare occasion that I land on one with minimal or even no ads, I appreciate it. I hope that you feel that way when you visit this site.</p>
      <p>With that, it is still my intention to earn an honest living creating content. If you are interested, there are a few direct ways, such as PayPal and CashApp, and I will also share some referral links from products and companies that I use personally and believe that you would appreciate. 
	      <br>No tricks.

	      No gimmick.</p>

        <h4>$WriterJoshua on Cash App</h4>
        <p>Cash App allowed me access to the stock market for the first time. By making it possible to purchase fractions of shares, it made the entire market more affordable. You can invest in many companies for as little as a dollar. It also has functionality that allows you send and receive money. Scan the QR code or use <a href="https://cash.app/$writerjoshua">$WriterJoshua on Cash App</a> to send cash if you like what I do and want to support.</p>

        <h4>Capital One Savor Rewards Card Referral</h4>
        <p>I've been using the Savor One Rewards Card since 2022 to get 4% back on all of my monthly subscriptions, like Netflix and Disney+, and when I use it restaurants. I also get 3% back when I use it at the grocery store. It really adds up. Now, when you're approved using my <a href="https://capital.one.4002gKv">Savor Rewards Card link</> I'll get $100. </p>

        <h4>$20 Off from UberEats</h4>
        <p>For a limited time, Capital One offered me a complimentary Uber Eats membership, plus 10% back on all orders. I use it for restaurants but, now I can get groceries and pet supplies delivered, as well. When you sign up using my code, you'll get $20 off your first order of $25+ and I'll get a code for $10 off my next order, too. Sign up at <a href="https://ubr.to/EatsGiveGet">ubr.to/EatsGiveGet</a> and use my code at checkout: eats-joshual7722ue</p>
