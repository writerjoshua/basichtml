      <p>I despise what advertising has become. They literally view us as herd animals to be manipulated. They have crossed the line from anticipating our needs to coercing our behavior. There is no gray area. So, I will not be monetizing this site with ads, no matter how well they can target you. It seems like every website I visit is littered with them, so on the rare occasion that I land on one with minimal or even no ads, I appreciate it. I hope that you feel that way when you visit this site.</p>
      <p>With that, it is still my intention to earn an honest living creating content. If you are interested, there are a few direct ways, such as PayPal and CashApp, and I will also share some referral links from products and companies that I use personally and believe that you would appreciate. No tricks. No gimmick.</p>
